                    <p> <em>I am a passionate and dedicated pre-service teacher currently studying education at <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/" target="_blank"> Australian Catholic University </a>, with a focus TAS. My journey into teaching stems from a deep love for learning and a desire to make a meaningful impact on young people's lives. I believe in creating inclusive, supportive and engaging classroom environments where students feel safe to explore ideas, ask questions and grow both academically and personally.</em> </p>
                    <p> <em>Throughout my studies, I’ve developed strong skills in lesson planning, classroom management and integrating technology into learning. I’ve completed professional experience placements in diverse school settings, where I’ve had the opportunity to teach, reflect and grow. Outside the classroom, I enjoy reading and travelling, which also influence my teaching style and ability to connect with students. I am committed to becoming the kind of teacher who not only educates but inspires.</em> </p>
