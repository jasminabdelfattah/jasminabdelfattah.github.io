## Overview
This portfolio website was developed as part of COMP208 Assessment 3 – Web App Project.
It showcases who I am as a future TAS teacher, demonstrates my technical and creative abilities and provides a professional space to present my teaching philosophy, resources, and experience.

The site builds upon my Assessment 1 design and now integrates HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an interactive and cohesive online portfolio.  

The site includes the following pages:
- **Home** – landing page introducing the portfolio.  
- **About Me** – personal introduction and teaching areas, styled to match the teaching philosophy layout.  
- **Resume** – downloadable PDF resume with clear formatting.  
- **Teaching Practice** – includes my teaching philosophy and an embedded video from my practicum.     
- **Resources** – downloadable NESA sample units.  
- **Contact** – contact form.

## Navigation
Navigation is consistent across all pages and located in the header.
The active link highlights the current page.
Each page uses a unified design featuring:

- Gradient headings
- Rounded white content boxes (.box.tp-philosophy)
- Consistent margins and typography
- Resume PDF – downloadable on the Resume page
- Sample Unit PDFs – downloadable from the Resources page
- Contact Form – accessible via the Contact page.

Description: Displays a one-time welcome popup message when the site is first opened.
- Uses the W3Schools popup box example (alert() method).
- Incorporates localStorage to ensure it only displays once per visitor.
- Includes a ?resetWelcome=1 URL parameter for testing.
- Credited appropriately within the JS file.
